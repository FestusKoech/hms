Objectives:

To and implement a centralised, secure, and web-based hospital management system for efficient patient data management across all departments.
To ensure timely access to accurate and up-to-date medical information for doctors, pharmacists, laboratory staff, and hospital administrators within six months of system deployment.
To improve efficiency and quality in hospital operations by reducing data duplication, paperwork, and retrieval time by at least 50% within the first year of implementation.
To support effective decision-making and hospital planning by providing real-time access to patient records and departmental reports across all departments within the first six months.
To maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and security through controlled access levels and encrypted storage, ensuring zero unauthorised data breaches during system use

Development:
Frontend Development - The system’s user interface is built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap 5 framework to ensure a responsive and user-friendly design.

Backend Development - The backend is developed using PHP (version 8+) following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to handle logic, data processing, and routing.

Database - The project uses MySQL as the main database management system to store patient records, lab reports, prescriptions, and user accounts.

Development Environment - The system is developed and tested locally using XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin) and coded in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Version Control - GitHub is used for source code management, version tracking, and collaborative development.

Security - The system implements CSRF protection, password hashing, and input validation to secure user data and prevent unauthorised access.
